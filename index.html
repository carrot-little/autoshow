        <h2>Low-overhead magic state distillation with color codes</h2>
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> 2409.07707v1</p>
        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 95</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for
achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum
error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied
method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to
tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both
logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such
optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their
higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of
Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two distillation
schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, which
differ in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme uses
faulty T-measurement, offering resource efficiency when the target infidelity
is above a certain threshold ($\sim 35p^3$ for physical error rate $p$). To
achieve lower infidelities while maintaining resource efficiency, our second
scheme exploits a distillation-free fault-tolerant magic state preparation
protocol, achieving significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\sim 10^{-19}$ for
$p = 10^{-4}$) than the first scheme. Notably, our schemes outperform the best
existing magic state distillation methods for color codes by up to about two
orders of magnitude in resource costs for a given achievable target infidelity.</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Open Problems:</strong></p>
        <p>The open problems identified in the paper include the following points:<br><br>1. <strong>Fault-Tolerant Implementation</strong>: Despite improvements, the schemes for magic state distillation (MSD) with color codes do not exceed the performance of surface code-based MSD. Enhancements are needed to the color code decoder to reach a higher circuit-level threshold (currently around \(0.5\%\)) to make it comparable to that of surface codes (approximately \(1\%\)).<br><br>2. <strong>Efficiency at High Error Rates</strong>: The combined MSD scheme with distance-7 patches for the Chamberland-Noh protocol lacks efficiency at high physical error rates (\(p \ge 10^{-3}\)), predominantly due to a low success rate of the CN protocol (approximately \(0.1\%\) for \(p = 10^{-3}\)).<br><br>3. <strong>Multi-Level MSD Schemes</strong>: The exploration of incorporating multi-level MSD schemes together with the CN protocol is suggested, particularly at code distances \(d_{CN} \in \{3, 5\}\).<br><br>4. <strong>Achievable Target Infidelity</strong>: The current output logical error rates must be improved, with aspirations to achieve significantly lower infidelities than are currently attainable  .<br><br>Additionally, the mathematical expressions mentioned in the open problems include:<br><br>- Logical error rate outputs are stated as:<br><br>\[<br>\text{Output logical error rate} \sim 35p^3,<br>\]<br><br>- A merging operation is described in time steps as:<br><br>\[<br>t^{(org)}_{dm} = 8 \cdot \text{trnd}(dm + 1),<br>\]<br><br>where \( \text{trnd} \) is time steps involved in each round【4:10†source】.</p>

        <h2>Quantum thermalization of translation-invariant systems at high temperature</h2>
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> 2409.07516v1</p>
        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 54</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively
reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the
reversibility of Schr\"odinger's equation and the irreversible entropy growth
dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and
conceptual significance, a complete proof of quantum thermalization has
remained elusive for several decades. Here, we prove that quantum
thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions
satisfying three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation
invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum.
Specifically, we show that a typical, initially unentangled pure state drawn
from any ensemble with maximum entropy becomes locally indistinguishable from a
Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. Our proof relies on a recent breakthrough
in quantum information theory proving the separability of high-temperature
thermal states, as well as on new technical results identifying sufficient
conditions for quantum thermalization, whose applicability extends beyond our
main result. Our work illustrates that statistical physics can be understood as
an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum
mechanics.</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Open Problems:</strong></p>
        <p>The paper discusses several open problems related to quantum thermalization, particularly focusing on translation-invariant systems. The key points for the open problems are as follows:<br><br>1. <strong>Proving the Conjecture for Nondegenerate Spectral Gaps</strong>: It remains an open question to prove that almost all \( k \)-local translation-invariant Hamiltonians on a D-dimensional periodic lattice have nondegenerate spectral gaps【4:5†source】. <br><br>2. <strong>Understanding Thermalization Conditions</strong>: The precise conditions under which quantum thermalization occurs are still not fully understood. Known examples of violations of quantum thermalization include localization, Bethe-ansatz integrability, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert-space fragmentation【4:4†source】.<br><br>3. <strong>Generalizing Results to Broader Systems</strong>: There's a need to extend the current results beyond qubits on lattices, to include systems such as bosonic particles with unbounded local Hilbert spaces, systems with symmetries, and general quantum field theories. The aim is to construct a universal framework that explains thermalization in various contexts【4:5†source】.<br><br>4. <strong>Improving Finite-Size Bounds</strong>: The authors suggest that tightening the existing finite-size bounds from \( N^{-1/2} \) to \( N^{-1} \) is an important direction for future research【4:5†source】.<br><br>5. <strong>Finite-time Behavior of Thermalization</strong>: Understanding the finite-time behavior, particularly in scenarios where certain translation-invariant systems do not thermalize until after exponentially long timescales, is highlighted as an important area for investigation【4:5†source】.<br><br>6. <strong>Existence of Energy-Delocalized Gibbs Ensembles</strong>: There is a need to provide explicit examples of energy-delocalized Gibbs ensembles, especially for finite temperatures, which presently pose significant challenges【4:6†source】. <br><br>These problems highlight both theoretical and practical challenges in the field, indicating directions for future research aimed at bridging gaps in understanding quantum thermalization.</p>

        <h2>Amortized Stabilizer Rényi Entropy of Quantum Dynamics</h2>
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> 2409.06659v1</p>
        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 39</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Unraveling the secrets of how much nonstabilizerness a quantum dynamic can
generate is crucial for harnessing the power of magic states, the essential
resources for achieving quantum advantage and realizing fault-tolerant quantum
computation. In this work, we introduce the amortized $\alpha$-stabilizer
R\'enyi entropy, a magic monotone for unitary operations that quantifies the
nonstabilizerness generation capability of quantum dynamics. Amortization is
key in quantifying the magic of quantum dynamics, as we reveal that
nonstabilizerness generation can be enhanced by prior nonstabilizerness in
input states when considering the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, while
this is not the case for robustness of magic or stabilizer extent. We
demonstrate the versatility of the amortized $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi
entropy in investigating the nonstabilizerness resources of quantum dynamics of
computational and fundamental interest. In particular, we establish improved
lower bounds on the $T$-count of quantum Fourier transforms and the quantum
evolutions of one-dimensional Heisenberg Hamiltonians, showcasing the power of
this tool in studying quantum advantages and the corresponding cost in
fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Open Problems:</strong></p>
        <p>The paper discusses several open problems related to the amortized α-stabilizer Rényi entropy in quantum dynamics. Here is a summary of these open problems:<br><br>1. <strong>Equality of Amortized Magic</strong>: It remains unknown whether the equality \( MA_{\alpha} (U^{\dagger}) = MA_{\alpha} (U) \) holds for any unitary operation \( U \). If it does not hold, it would imply a distinct phenomenon where the capacities for nonstabilizerness generation and destruction of \( U \) differ, paralleling the behavior of entanglement measures.<br><br>2. <strong>General Formulation</strong>: The characterization of the maximum amount of nonstabilizerness that can be generated by a unitary operation is still an open question, inviting further exploration into the properties and formulations of amortized magic.<br><br>3. <strong>Connection with Other Measures</strong>: The implications of the results regarding amortized α-stabilizer Rényi entropy on other measures of quantum magic, such as robustness and extent of magic, warrant further investigation.<br><br>4. <strong>Extension to Broader Classes</strong>: Exploring whether the findings related to the amortized α-stabilizer Rényi entropy can be extended to classes of quantum operations beyond multi-qubit unitaries also poses a significant challenge.<br><br>Mathematical formulas mentioned in these problems include:<br>- The equality to be investigated: \( MA_{\alpha} (U^{\dagger}) = MA_{\alpha} (U) \).<br>- The characterization of nonstabilizerness: \( t(U) \geq \frac{MA(U)}{MA(T)} \).<br>- The current findings suggest that \( MA_{2} (T) = 2 - \log_{2}(3) \) and \( MA_{2} (CCZ) = 5 - \log_{2}(11) \)【6:11†source】.</p>

        <h2>The Black-Box Simulation Barrier Persists in a Fully Quantum World</h2>
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> 2409.06317v1</p>
        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 35</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols have been intensely studied due to their
fundamental importance and versatility. However, quantum information's inherent
differences significantly alter the landscape, necessitating a re-examination
of ZK designs.
  A crucial aspect is round complexity, linked to $\textit{simulation}$, which
forms the foundation of ZK definition and security proofs. In the
$\textit{post-quantum}$ setting, where honest parties and channels are
classical but adversaries quantum, Chia et al. [FOCS'21] showed constant-round
$\textit{black-box-simulatable}$ ZK arguments (BBZK) for $\mathbf{NP}$ are
impossible unless $\mathbf{NP} \subseteq \mathbf{BQP}$. But this problem
remains open when all parties and communication are quantum.
  Indeed, this problem interests the broader theory of quantum computing.
Investigating how quantum power alters tasks like the $\textit{unconditional}$
security of QKD and incorporating OT in MiniQCrypt has been crucial. Moreover,
quantum communication has enabled round compression for commitments and
interactive arguments. Along this line, understanding if quantum computing
could fundamentally change ZK protocols is vital.
  We resolved this problem by proving that only languages in $\mathbf{BQP}$
admit constant-round $\textit{fully-quantum}$ BBZK. This result holds
significant implications. Firstly, it illuminates the nature of quantum
zero-knowledge and provides valuable insights for designing future protocols in
the quantum realm. Secondly, it relates ZK round complexity with the intriguing
problem of $\mathbf{BQP}$ vs $\mathbf{QMA}$, which is out of the reach of
previous analogue impossibility results in the classical or post-quantum
setting. Lastly, it justifies the need for the $\textit{non-black-box}$
simulation techniques or the relaxed security notions employed in existing
constant-round fully-quantum BBZK protocols.</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Open Problems:</strong></p>
        <p>The open problems identified in the paper are as follows:<br><br>1. <strong>Constant-Round Fully-Quantum BBZK Protocols</strong>:<br>   - Question: Do there exist constant-round fully-quantum BBZK protocols for NP (or QMA) with strict (or expected) QPT simulation?<br><br>2. <strong>Mathematical Implication</strong>:<br>   - Theorem 1 states that for any language \( L \), if there exists a constant-round fully-quantum BBZK protocol with expected QPT simulation, then it holds that \( L \in \text{BQP} \):<br>   \[<br>   L \in \text{BQP} \quad \text{if} \quad \text{constant-round fully-quantum BBZK exists}<br>   \]<br><br>3. <strong>Corollary on QMA</strong>:<br>   - Corollary 1: There does not exist any constant-round fully-quantum BBZK protocol for QMA (resp.

        <h2>Concentration of quantum channels with random Kraus operators via matrix Bernstein inequality</h2>
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> 2409.06862v1</p>
        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 35</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>In this study, we generate quantum channels with random Kraus operators to
typically obtain almost twirling quantum channels and quantum expanders. To
prove the concentration phenomena, we use matrix Bernstein's inequality. In
this way, our random models do not utilize Haar-distributed unitary matrices or
Gaussian matrices. Rather, as in the preceding research, we use unitary
$t$-designs to generate mixed tenor-product unitary channels acting on $\mathbb
C^{d^t}$. Although our bounds in Schatten $p$-norm are valid only for $1\leq p
\leq 2$, we show that they are typically almost twirling quantum channels with
the tail bound proportional to $1/\mathrm{poly}(d^t)$, while such bounds were
previously constants. The number of required Kraus operators was also improved
by powers of $\log d$ and $t$. Such random quantum channels are also typically
quantum expanders, but the number of Kraus operators must grow proportionally
to $\log d$ in our case. Finally, a new non-unital model of super-operators
generated by bounded and isotropic random Kraus operators was introduced, which
can be typically rectified to give almost randomizing quantum channels and
quantum expanders.</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Open Problems:</strong></p>
        <p>The paper discusses several open problems related to quantum channels with random Kraus operators, particularly focusing on the concentration phenomena and quantum expanders. Here are the main open problems summarized:<br><br>1. Exploring the tightness of the bounds used in the results: While the paper uses Bernstein's inequality, it notes that the calculations for certain bounds, specifically \( M \) and \( V \) in their propositions, are not very tight. A problem is to develop methods that yield tighter bounds and better estimates.<br><br>2. Investigating the scaling properties of the number of Kraus operators: The demand for the number of Kraus operators to grow proportional to \( \log d \) for quantum expanders indicates an area for further research. Understanding if this requirement can be relaxed or optimized remains an open question.<br><br>3. Conditions for almost randomizing channels: The paper introduces new random models that only require basic second-moment conditions on the Kraus operators. More exploration is needed to establish comprehensive conditions under which these channels behave as expected, focusing on the performance of such models.<br><br>4. Understanding the spectral gaps more generally: The conditions for the spectral gap to exist, primarily using the lower bounds of second largest eigenvalues, prompt further investigation into other possible frameworks or theoretical tools that can describe the phenomena of quantum expanders more effectively.<br><br>5. Extending the results to broader classes of quantum channels: The results in this paper are primarily confined to certain types of quantum channels. An open problem is whether similar results can extend to other classes of quantum operations or formulations.<br><br>Mathematical formulas are present within the context of the open problems discussed:<br>- The requirement for a quantum \( (1−\epsilon) \)-expander states the bounds as follows:<br>  \[<br>  | \lambda_2 | < \epsilon<br>  \]<br>- The growth requirement on the number of Kraus operators typically implied is:<br>  \[<br>  k \geq Ct \log d / \epsilon^2<br>  \]<br><br>The intricacies of how these parameters influence the overall structure and behavior of quantum channels remain an area of ongoing investigation.</p>

        <h2>On the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians</h2>
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> 2409.09685v1</p>
        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 35</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>We prove that the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free
Hamiltonians is of inverse-square type. The novelty of this note is that the
result is proved on general graphs and for general finite-range interactions.
Therefore, the inverse-square critical gap scaling is a robust, universal
property of finite-range frustration-free Hamiltonians. This places further
limits on their ability to produce conformal field theories in the continuum
limit. Our proof refines the divide-and-conquer strategy of Kastoryano and the
second author through the refined Detectability Lemma of Gosset--Huang.</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Open Problems:</strong></p>
        <p>The paper discusses several open problems related to the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians and their gap scaling properties.

It states that:<br>   \[<br>   \text{Haldane conjecture: } \text{All integer-spin Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains are gapped.}<br>   \]<br><br>2. <strong>Inverse-Square Gap Scaling</strong>:<br>   The paper establishes that if the infinite-volume gap vanishes, the finite-size gaps must close at least as fast as the inverse square of the linear dimension:<br>   \[<br>   \text{gap}(F_k) = o\left(\frac{k^{4+\epsilon}}{l_k^2}\right) \quad \text{as } k \to \infty.<br>   \]<br>   This result implies a need to further explore conditions under which this rate is maintained.<br><br>3. <strong>Bound on the Spectral Gap</strong>:<br>   The proposition therein states:<br>   \[<br>   \text{If } \liminf_{k \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt{\lambda_k}}{l_k k s_k} > 0, \text{ then } \text{gap}(\Gamma) > 0.<br>   \]<br>   This ties into the structure of certain Hamiltonians and their spectral properties, inviting deeper inquiry into the relations between parameters.<br><br>These problems are crucial for understanding the mathematical framework of quantum systems, particularly in relation to the robustness of gap properties across varied interaction models and graph structures【6:0†source】.</p>

        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 25</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>This tutorial introduces a systematic approach for addressing the key
question of quantum metrology: For a generic task of sensing an unknown
parameter, what is the ultimate precision given a constrained set of admissible
strategies. The approach outputs the maximal attainable precision (in terms of
the maximum of quantum Fisher information) as a semidefinite program and
optimal strategies as feasible solutions thereof. Remarkably, the approach can
identify the optimal precision for different sets of strategies, including
parallel, sequential, quantum SWITCH-enhanced, causally superposed, and generic
indefinite-causal-order strategies. The tutorial consists of a pedagogic
introduction to the background and mathematical tools of optimal quantum
metrology, a detailed derivation of the main approach, and various concrete
examples. As shown in the tutorial, applications of the approach include, but
are not limited to, strict hierarchy of strategies in noisy quantum metrology,
memory effect in non-Markovian metrology, and designing optimal strategies.
Compared with traditional approaches, the approach here yields the exact value
of the optimal precision, offering more accurate criteria for experiments and
practical applications. It also allows for the comparison between conventional
strategies and the recently discovered causally-indefinite strategies, serving
as a powerful tool for exploring this new area of quantum metrology.</p>

        <p><strong>Scites:</strong> 23</p>
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse
consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we
formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some
data and Bob holds $m$ inputs, and he wants to compute $m$ instances of a
bipartite relation on Alice's data and each of his inputs. We call this the
asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of
examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales
polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at
most logarithmically on $m$.
  For these examples, data behaves like a consumable resource when the owner

        <p>The paper outlines several open problems in communication complexity related to consumable quantum data. Here are the main questions highlighted:<br><br>1.

        <h2>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</h2>

        <p class="highlight"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement
from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication
while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of
embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was
shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between
embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined
by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional
approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling
families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling
state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an
embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion
distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by
Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting.
By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$
factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in
the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open
problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two
spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether
multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</p>
